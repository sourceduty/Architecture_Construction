![Makeshift House](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f86eceaf-1a0b-41d1-a9d2-996012d2c59b)

The term "makeshift" refers to a temporary or improvised solution, often created quickly out of necessity using available resources rather than ideal or permanent materials. A makeshift house or product design typically emerges in situations where time, budget, or access to conventional tools and materials is limited—such as during natural disasters, emergencies, or in remote locations. These structures or objects prioritize function and immediate usability over durability or aesthetic appeal. For example, a makeshift house might be built from salvaged wood, tarps, or corrugated metal, providing basic shelter without formal planning or architectural design. Similarly, a makeshift product design could involve repurposing household items to fulfill an urgent need, like turning a plastic bottle into a watering can or using crates as furniture. While makeshift solutions are inherently temporary and often lack polish, they demonstrate creativity, resilience, and adaptability in challenging circumstances.

![Pyramid Sand Art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc6651d7-b8b7-4e9b-a0cd-c13b21c2f7e2)

The ancient Egyptians invested lifetimes into the future of mankind and the adundance of environmental space when they designed and constructed thier very large, strong and complex stone structures. The desertified location for the Great Pyramid of Giza was chosen because of the empty sand covered landscape that is mostly unused by people, animals and plants. Today, in comparison to modern engineering feats, Egyptian structures are outdated and almost unnecessary. These structures are reinvested into the futures of mankind every day, year and century that passes without destruction.
